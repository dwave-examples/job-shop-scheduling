# Job Shop Scheduling using CQM

[Job shop scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job-shop_scheduling) is an
optimization problem where the goal is to schedule jobs on a certain number of
machines according to a process order for each job. The objective is to minimize
the length of schedule also called make-span, or completion time of the last
task of all jobs.

This example demonstrates a means of formulating and optimizing job shop
scheduling (JSS) using a
[constrained quadratic model](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/concepts/models.html#constrained-quadratic-model) (CQM) that can be solved using a Leap hybrid
CQM solver. Contained in this example is the code for running the job shop
scheduler as well as a user interface built with
[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).

## Installation

You can run this example without installation in cloud-based IDEs that support
the
[Development Containers specification](https://containers.dev/supporting) (aka
"devcontainers") such as GitHub Codespaces.

For development environments that do not support `devcontainers`, install
requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are cloning the repo to your local system, working in a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is
recommended.

## Usage

Your development environment should be configured to access the
[Leap&trade; quantum cloud service](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/ocean/sapi_access_basic.html).
You can see information about supported IDEs and authorizing access to your Leap
account
[here](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/leap_sapi/dev_env.html).

Run the following terminal command to start the Dash application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Access the user interface with your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8050/.

To run the stand-alone job shop demo (without the user interface), use the
command:

    python job_shop_scheduler.py [-h] [-i INSTANCE] [-tl TIME_LIMIT] [-os OUTPUT_SOLUTION] [-op OUTPUT_PLOT] [-m] [-v] [-q] [-p PROFILE] [-mm MAX_MAKESPAN]

This will call the job shop scheduling algorithm for the input instance file.
Command line arguments are defined as:

-   -h (or --help): show this help message and exit
-   -i (--instance): path to the input instance file;
    (default: input/instance5_5.txt)
-   -tl (--time_limit) time limit in seconds (default: None)
-   -os (--output_solution): path to the output solution file
    (default: output/solution.txt)
-   -op (--output_plot): path to the output plot file
    (default: output/schedule.png)
-   -m (--use_mip_solver): Whether to use the MIP solver instead of the CQM
    solver (default: False)
-   -v (--verbose): Whether to print verbose output (default: True)
-   -q (--allow_quad): Whether to allow quadratic constraints (default: False)
-   -p (--profile): The profile variable to pass to the Sampler. Defaults to
    None. (default: None)
-   -mm (--max_makespan): Upperbound on how long the schedule can be; leave
    empty to auto-calculate an appropriate value. (default: None)

There are several instances pre-populated under `input` folder. Some of the
instances were randomly generated using `utils/jss_generator.py` as discussed
under the [Problem generator](#Generating-Problem-Instances) section.

Other instances were pulled from [E. Taillard's list] of benchmarking instances.
If the string "taillard" is contained in the filename, the model will expect the
input file to match the format used by Taillard. Otherwise, the following format
is expected:

```
#Num of jobs: 5
#Num of machines: 5
                task 0            task 1            task 2            task 3            task 4
  job id    machine    dur    machine    dur    machine    dur    machine    dur    machine    dur
--------  ---------  -----  ---------  -----  ---------  -----  ---------  -----  ---------  -----
       0          1      3          3      4          4      4          0      5          2      1
       1          3      4          2      0          1      0          0      1          4      0
       2          1      5          4      5          2      4          0      0          3      3
       3          4      1          3      4          0      2          2      0          1      2
       4          1      3          3      3          0      0          2      0          4      1

```

Note that:
-   tasks must be executed sequentially;
-   `dur` refers to the processing duration of a task;
-   this demo solves a variant of job-shop-scheduling problem

The program produces a solution schedule like this:

```
#Number of jobs: 5
#Number of machines: 5
#Completion time: 22.0

                  machine 0               machine 1               machine 2               machine 3               machine 4
  job id    task    start    dur    task    start    dur    task    start    dur    task    start    dur    task    start    dur
--------  ------  -------  -----  ------  -------  -----  ------  -------  -----  ------  -------  -----  ------  -------  -----
       0       3       16      5       0        5      3       4       21      1       1        8      4       2       12      4
       1       3        6      1       2        5      0       1        4      0       0        0      4       4        9      0
       2       3       17      0       0        0      5       2       13      4       4       17      3       1        6      5
       3       2        9      2       4       19      2       3       14      0       1        4      4       0        1      1
       4       2       18      0       0        9      3       3       21      0       1       14      3       4       21      1
```

### Generating Problem Instances

`utils/jss_generator.py` can be used to generate random problem instances.
For example, a 5 * 6 instance with a maximum duration of 8 hours can be
generated with:

`python utils/jss_generator.py 5 6 8 -path < folder location to store generated instance file >`

To see a full description of the options, type:

`python utils/jss_generator.py -h`

## Model and Code Overview

### Problem Parameters

These are the parameters of the problem:

-   `n` : is the number of jobs
-   `m` : is the number of machines
-   `J` : is the set of jobs (`{0,1,2,...,n}`)
-   `M` : is the set of machines (`{0,1,2,...,m}`)
-   `T` : is the set of tasks (`{0,1,2,...,m}`) that has same dimension as `M`.
-   `M_(j,t)`:  is the machine that processes task `t` of job `j`
-   `T_(j,i)`  : is the task that is processed by machine `i` for job `j`
-   `D_(j,t)`:  is the processing duration that task `t` needs for job `j`
-   `V`:  maximum possible make-span

### Variables

-   `w` is a positive integer variable that defines the completion time
    (make-span) of the JSS
-   `x_(j_i)` are positive integer variables used to model start of each job `j`
    on machine `i`
-   `y_(j_k,i)` are binaries which define if job `k` precedes job `j` on machine
    `i`

### Objective

Our objective is to minimize the make-span (`w`) of the given JSS problem.

### Constraints

#### Precedence Constraint

Our first constraint, [equation 1](#eq2), enforces the precedence constraint.
This ensures that all tasks of a job are executed in the given order.

![equation1](_static/eq1.png)          (1)

This constraint ensures that a task for a given job, `j`, on a machine,
`M_(j,t)`, starts when the previous task is finished. As an example, for
consecutive tasks 4 and 5 of job 3 that run on machine 6 and 1, respectively,
assuming that task 4 takes 12 hours to finish, we add this constraint:
`x_3_6 >= x_3_1 + 12`

#### No-Overlap Constraints

Our second constraint, [equation 2](#eq2), ensures that multiple jobs don't use
any machine at the same time.
![eq2](_static/eq2.png)          (2)

Usually this constraint is modeled as two disjunctive linear constraints
([Ku et al. 2016](#Ku) and [Manne et al. 1960](#Manne)); however, it is more
efficient to model this as a single quadratic inequality constraint. In
addition, using this quadratic equation eliminates the need for using the so
called `Big M` value to activate or relax constraint
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_M_method).

The proposed quadratic equation fulfills the same behaviour as the linear
constraints:

There are two cases:

-   if `y_j,k,i = 0` job `j` is processed after job `k`:

    ![equation2_1](_static/eq2_1.png)
-   if `y_j,k,i = 1` job `k` is processed after job `j`:

    ![equation2_2](_static/eq2_2.png)

    Since these equations are applied to every pair of jobs, they guarantee that
    the jobs don't overlap on a machine. If -allow_quad is set to False, this
    mixed integer formulation of this constraint will be used.

#### Make-Span Constraint

In this demonstration, the maximum makespan can be defined by the user or it
will be determined using a greedy heuristic. Placing an upper bound on the
makespan improves the performance of the D-Wave sampler; however, if the upper
bound is too low then the sampler may fail to find a feasible solution.
