    """Returns a BQM to the Job Shop Scheduling problem.

    Args:
        job_dict: A dict. Contains the jobs we're interested in scheduling. (See Example below.)
        max_time: An integer. The upper bound on the amount of time the schedule can take.
        stitch_kwargs: A dict. Kwargs to be passed through get_jss_bqm to dwavebinarycsp.stitch.

    Returns:
        A dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel. Note: The nodes in the BQM are labelled in the format,
          <job_name>_<task_number>,<time>. (See Example below)

    Example:
        'jobs' dict describes the jobs we're interested in scheduling. Namely, the dict key is the
         name of the job and the dict value is the ordered list of tasks that the job must do.

        It follows the format:
          {"job_name": [(machine_name, time_duration_on_machine), ..],
           "another_job_name": [(some_machine, time_duration_on_machine), ..]}

        Interpreting Results:
          Consider the node, "b_0,2" with a value of 1.
          - "b_0,2" is interpreted as job b, task 0, at time 2
          - Job b's 0th task is ("mixer", 1)
          - Hence, at time 2, Job b's 0th task is turned on

          Consider the node, "a_1,0" with a value of 0.
          - "a_1,0" is interpreted as job a, task 1, at time 0
          - Job a's 1st task is ("oven", 1)
          - Hence, at time 0, Job a's 1st task is not run

        #   the optimal schedule is only dependent on when the LAST task is run, it is irrelevant
        #   when the first N-1 tasks end.) Note that by "worst" optimal schedule, I am merely
        #   referring to the most heavily penalized optimal schedule.
        #
        # Show math satisfies any-optimal-schedule-penalty < any-non-optimal-schedule-penalty:

        #   of the entire schedule is the sum of penalties of these chosen tasks.
        # - Chose the base of my geometric series to be N+1. This simplifies the math and it will
        #   become apparent why it's handy later on.
        #
        # - Comparing the SUM of penalties between any optimal schedule (on left) with that of the
        #   WORST optimal schedule (on right). As shown below, in this penalty scheme, any optimal
        #   schedule penalty <= the worst optimal schedule.
        #     sum_i (N+1)^t_i <= N * (N+1)^t_N, where t_i the time when the task i ends  [eq 1]
        #
        # - Now let's show that all optimal schedule penalties < any non-optimal schedule penalty.
        #   We can prove this by applying eq 1 and simply proving that the worst optimal schedule
        #   penalty (below, on left) is always less than any non-optimal schedule penalty.
        #     N * (N+1)^t_N < (N+1)^(t_N + 1)
        #                               Note: t_N + 1 is the smallest end time for a non-optimal
