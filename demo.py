#   task_times = {"job": [start_time_for_task0, start_time_for_task1, ..],
#                 "other_job": [start_time_for_task0, ..]
#                 ..}
#
# Note1: each node in our BQM is labelled as "<job>_<task_index>,<time>".
#  For example, the node "cupcakes_1,2" refers to job 'cupcakes', its 1st task
#  (where we are using zero-indexing, so task '("oven", 1)'), starting at time
#  2.
#
#  Hence, we are grabbing the nodes selected by our solver (i.e. nodes flagged
#  with 1s) that will make a good schedule.
#  (see next line of code, 'selected_nodes')
